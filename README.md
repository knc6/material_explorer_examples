# Material Explorer 1.0  

**Material Explorer 1.0** is a specialized assistant for material science research. It helps users explore material properties, crystal structures, phase diagrams, and computational simulations. It provides data from sources like **JARVIS-DFT, AFLOW, C2DB, and Alexandria** etc. to assist in material selection, comparison, and application.  

## ðŸ”¹ Key Features  
- âœ… Fetching material properties (density, energy, bulk modulus)  
- âœ… Identifying crystal structures and space groups  
- âœ… Predicting bandgaps and formation energy  
- âœ… Guiding simulations (DFT, MD, phase stability)  
- âœ… Recommending experimental techniques  

### ðŸ”¬ Ideal For  
Researchers, engineers, and students working on material discovery and characterization. âœ¨  


# ChatGPT Material Exlorer Example Prompts:

1. Find all materials containing Carbon (C) and Silicon (Si) in the JARVIS-DFT database and their total number. Present in table format.
2. Find all materials containing Carbon (C) and Silicon (Si) in the C2DB database and their total number. Present in table format.
3. Find all materials containing chemical formula MoS2 in the JARVIS-DFT database and their total number. Present in table format. (Note chemical formula should be alphabetically ordered, so O2Si not SiO2)
4. Predict properties of this Poscar file using ALIGNN for atomic structure: MySytem
